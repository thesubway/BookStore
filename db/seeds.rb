        CoffeeScript is JavaScript done right. It provides all of JavaScript's

  functionality wrapped in a cleaner, more succinct syntax. In the first

  book on this exciting new language, CoffeeScript guru Trevor Burnham

  shows you how to hold onto all the power and flexibility of JavaScript

  while writing clearer, cleaner, and safer code.
